AWS Security Groups are a flexible tool to help you secure your Amazon EC2 instances. 
AWS Security Groups are just one of several tools AWS offers to help you secure your cloud environment, 
but that doesn’t mean AWS security is hands-off. You’re still responsible for securing your applications and data in the cloud, 
and that means you need to leverage additional tools, such as Threat Stack, to gain better visibility and take a proactive approach to security in the cloud. Threat Stack is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner, offering an intrusion detection platform that’s built in AWS, to serve AWS.

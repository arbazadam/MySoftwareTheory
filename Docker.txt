Docker notes..

Image:- An image is a compressed,self-contained piece of software which has to be unwrapped in order to use the functionality.Now Now this image may contain any software,operating system,service etc.

What is a docker image?

A docker image is created by the sequence of commands written in a file called as Dockerfile. When this docker file is executed using a docker command it results into a docker image with a name which we specify. When the image is executed by "docker run" command it will by itself start whatever application or a service it has to start on its execution.

Repository:- A repository is the place on cloud which holds the different version of an image.

Registry:-A registry is a cloud hosting platform which can hold your repository.

Docker Commands: docker pull  //This command will download an image from the docker registry and store it on a local machine...
		 docker images //This will list all the images present on your system locally.
		 docker container ls //This will list all the running instances of the image.
		 docker container exec container_name ls /tmp //This command is used to execute commands on a running container, in this example it lists all the files in the tmp folder of the running container.
		 docker container cp file_from_the_local_machine container_name:/tmp //Copies file from the host machine inside the container.
		 docker container commit container_name image_name:image_tag //Creating an image out of the running container.
		 docker container commit --change ='cmd ["java","-jar","jar_name"] //This command is used to specify, which command is to be run on the container startup.
		 docker container stop container_id //Command to stop a docker container.
		 docker history image_name //Gives the entire history of the image, when it was created what of steps were involved.

#There are two steps to create a docker image. One is manual and the other one is to create a docker file. In order to create a docker file we must create a file with "Dockerfile"
